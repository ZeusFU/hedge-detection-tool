Using the dataset of futures trades including tradehash, short_long, asset, entry_datetime, market_entries, close_datetime, market_closes, account_id, user_id, quantities_bought, and quantities_sold, analyze hedging behavior by identifying trade pairs that:
1. Involve the same underlying asset (e.g., treat NQM5 and MNQM5 as equivalent).
2. Have opposite trade directions (LONG vs SHORT).
3. Have market entry prices within $5 of each other.
4. Have entry times overlappingâ€”the entry of one trade must occur within the entry-to-exit duration of the other.
5. Optionally, have close prices near each other, to support matching.
6. Can be grouped by:
    * Same user, different account (self-hedging)
    * Different users (external coordination)
For each matched pair:
* Output a confidence score based on how well they match the above criteria.
* Tag each pair as either self_hedge or inter_user_hedge.
* Track cumulative profits from each side of the hedge.
Summarize:
* Total number of self_hedge vs inter_user_hedge cases.
* Number and % of users and accounts involved in hedging behavior.
* Frequency of matching trades per user.
* Average confidence score per hedge.
* Any notable clusters of hedges (same times, same assets).
Bonus:
* Highlight any user_id or account_id that appears in a large number of hedge pairs.
* Detect repeat patterns of this behavior (e.g. same time each day, same price range).
